Authors - Onwuka Chukwuebuka & Chiagoziem Elgibbbor

"printf" which stands for print formatted is a pre-defined function in the C  library used to write formatted output to the cosole or stdout. it takes a variable number of arguments and this makes it a variadic function or we say, it is implemented a s a variadic function.
in this project, we are creating our own _printf() function that replicates the standard printf() function in c library.
